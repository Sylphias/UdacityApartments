Took about 3-4 hours to complete and experiment around.

## Thoughts and Notes
I think learing the lightmaps and animations were the 2 biggest takeaway for this projects.

I think the largest challenge is working within the hardware restrictions of mobile VR, the lightmapping and settings were a little troublesome to play around with because of the build time (the time needed to bake the results out)

Can't wait for a more challenging project!
